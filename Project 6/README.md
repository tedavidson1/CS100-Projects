This was my sixth CS 100 project.

Grade: 100%

Using two structs, I implemented the linked list data structure and 9 operations:

addStudent – add a student, using the “add-at-front” method.

addGrade – add a grade to a student, using the “add-at-end” method.

count – return the number of students in the linked list.

printStudent – print the information of a student (the student name and all the grades for that student).

print – prints all students. For each student, print the name and all the grades for that student.

addStudentOrdered – add a studentin alphabetical order (ordered add of a student).

addGradeOrdered – add a grade to a student based on the grade name (ordered add of a grade).

removeGrade – remove the specified grade froma student and free the related node.

removeStudent – remove the specified student and all the grades of that student. You shall also free all the related space.

interface.c and gradebook.h were provided to us. gradebook.c was provided as a skeleton (functions defined but no code inside)
